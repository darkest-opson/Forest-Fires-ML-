##Description
In this project, I collaborated with a team of data scientists to predict the Fire Weather Index in Algerian Forests using Ridge Regression. We used a pickled standard scaler and Ridge Regression model to develop a predictive algorithm that can aid in preventing forest fires.

We deployed our model on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk and Code Pipeline from Github. The project was an exciting opportunity to apply our skills in data science and machine learning to solve a real-world problem.

Throughout the project, we gained valuable experience in working with large datasets, developing predictive algorithms, and deploying models on cloud platforms. Our goal was to help prevent forest fires and protect the environment, and we're proud of what we accomplished.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to have worked on this project with a talented team, and I'm excited to see the impact our model will have on the prevention of forest fires in Algeria.
